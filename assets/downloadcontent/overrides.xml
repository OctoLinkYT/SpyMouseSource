The Device Overrides file is used to specify device-specific resolution overrides.  This file is optional, and is intended to be 
used by game teams only.

Structure is as follows:

<devices>
 	<device name="DeviceName1">
		<resolution width="123" height="456"/> 	
 	</device>
 	<device name="DeviceName2">
		<resolution width="789" height="012"/> 	
 	</device>
 	...
</devices>

In the "devices" element add or remove devices as needed for your game. The device name needs to be the same returned by android.os.Build.MODEL (Android SDK). The example below is an override for XperiaPlay (X10i):

	<device name="X10i">
		<resolution width="480" height="320"/> 
	</device>	

Note, the device name is case-sensitive and matches the whole name only. In other words, "x10i" or "SonyEricsson X10i" will not match "X10i" (the correct device name)
